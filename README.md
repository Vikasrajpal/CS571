# Aim and objectives
The fundamental focus of this projectwork is to make use of Tkinter library in python and compose a GUI interface alongwith usage of Data structures & Object oriented programming skills. The Objective is to build up an application which accepts the customer and order details as inputs. After that the program creates a invoice for a customer or consumer, with each purchase of the given item.

# Python Tkinter library based GUI program application used to manage and execute multiple operations related to order details on your system. User can perform operations like

# Data structures
A data structure is a way of organizing and storing data in a program, and it can be modified and accessed easily later. Basically, data structures have two types one is primitive data types like, integer, float, string. And another is collection data types like, list, tuples, dictionary etc. But this program the following data structure which has been used; string, integer and float.

# Manual Testing
![Result](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/88109927/142979289-6916832f-2eac-43b2-8f95-efd20f8a8f23.png)
 The program was tested against multiple manual inputs and calculated total bill was verified by hand calculation.
 
# Summary
We first impoted the necessary libraies. Then We solved the problem by first creating a window which is the fundamental element of GUI. Windows are the containers in which all other GUI elements live. These other GUI elements, such as text boxes, labels, and buttons, are known as widgets. Then we display text and images using Label widget and also the clickable buttons, i.e Total Bill","Clear Field", "Exit".
Then we take the input from user by creating entry widget. Finally assigning Widgets to Frames With Frame Widgets to create our framework GUI.
