# Aim and objectives
The fundamental focus of this projectwork is to make use of Tkinter library in python and compose a GUI interface alongwith usage of Data structures & Object oriented programming skills. The Objective is to build up an application which accepts the customer and order details as inputs. After that the program creates a invoice for a customer or consumer, with each purchase of the given item.

# Python Tkinter library based GUI program application used to manage and execute multiple operations related to order details on your system. User can perform operations like
```
Customer Name
Contact Number
Bill NO.
```
```
Fast Food items
Grocery items
Taxes
Total Calculated Bill
Clear Field
Exit
```

# Data structures
A data structure is a way of organizing and storing data in a program, and it can be modified and accessed easily later. Basically, data structures have two types one is primitive data types like, integer, float, string. And another is collection data types like, list, tuples, dictionary etc. But this program the following data structure which has been used; string, integer and float.

# Algorithm Used : Tkinter

Python provides the standard library Tkinter for creating the graphical user interface for desktop based applications.

Developing desktop based applications with python Tkinter is not a complex task. An empty Tkinter top-level window can be created by using the following steps.
```
Import the Tkinter module.
Create the main application window.
Add the widgets like labels, buttons, frames, etc. to the window.
Call the main event loop so that the actions can take place on the user's computer screen.
```

# Manual Testing
![Result](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/88109927/142979289-6916832f-2eac-43b2-8f95-efd20f8a8f23.png)
 The program was tested against multiple manual inputs and calculated total bill was verified by hand calculation.
 
# Summary
We first impoted the necessary libraies. Then We solved the problem by first creating a window which is the fundamental element of GUI. Windows are the containers in which all other GUI elements live. These other GUI elements, such as text boxes, labels, and buttons, are known as widgets. Then we display text and images using Label widget and also the clickable buttons, i.e Total Bill","Clear Field", "Exit".
Then we take the input from user by creating entry widget. Finally assigning Widgets to Frames With Frame Widgets to create our framework GUI.

# Conclusion
The entire project has been developed and deployed as per the requirements and convenience of the concerned executive and the user, it is found to be bug free as it is tested against multiple manual inputs. The customers will come to know the prices of each commodity clearly as not in the case of bad handwriting in the bills. Also, the ease of this digitally generated bill will help in maintaining the accounts section well.
